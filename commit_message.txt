feat: Implement multiple Mikrotik PPPoE servers per area code and align UI design

This commit introduces the ability to associate Mikrotik PPPoE servers with specific coverage areas and aligns the UI design with existing customer and internet plan pages.

Changes include:
- Database migration to replace `area_code` with `coverage_id` in `mikrotik_servers` table.
- Updated `MikrotikServer` and `Coverage` models to define `belongsTo` and `hasMany` relationships.
- Modified `MikrotikServerController` to handle `coverage_id` for CRUD operations and eager load `coverage` data.
- Updated frontend components (`create.tsx`, `edit.tsx`, `index.tsx`) to use a dropdown for selecting coverage areas and display the coverage area name, and to align with the design patterns of other pages.
